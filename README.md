# **Velocity**
A fun and simple mobile game made with kivy.

In velocity you control two balls, one on each side of the screen. Tap to boost one of the balls into the air, aiming at to reach a maximum height. There will be various unique obstacles in the way. Some are bouncy, some move, others don't. 

This is my first time using kivy so it's not overly complex, I hope you still enjoy playing it and find it entertaining.
